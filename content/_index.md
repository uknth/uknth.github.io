I'm an architect [@Unbxd](https://unbxd.com). I have worked in variety of roles from customer relations to product development. I have wide range of experience in various domains.

Although, I am currently in a leadership role, I still prefer being the OG engineer who grew with the org and developed the system which runs the heart of the business.

I love gaming, I have more than 6000 hours on DOTA2, but my first love was Age of Empires 2. I prefer RTS & MOBA over FPS.

In any party, you will find me behind the bar counter, making drinks for everyone. I occasionally cook.

I am desperately trying to learn guitar. When not playing guitar, I like to read.
