title = "About Me"
+++

I'm an architect @Unbxd. I have worked in a variety of roles, from customer relations to product development. I have a wide range of experience in various domains.

Although I am currently in a leadership role, I still prefer being the OG engineer who grew with the org and developed the system that runs the heart of the business.

I love gaming; I have more than 6000 hours on DOTA2, but my first love was Age of Empires 2. I prefer RTS & MOBA over FPS.

At any party, you will find me behind the bar counter, making drinks for everyone. I occasionally cook.

Married to [@PinxBorah](https://twitter.com/pinxborah).

I am desperately trying to learn guitar. When not playing guitar, I like to read.
